# Comments in python 
* Comments in Python are identified with a hash symbol, #, and extend to the end of the line.
* Comments can be used to explain Python code.
* Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
* Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
* Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
* To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
# Example 
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")

# Benefits of Python Programming Language:

# Structuring Python Programs
* one statement in one line 
* Multiple Statements per Line
* Line Continuation to avoid left and right scrolling
Some statements may become very long and may force you to scroll the screen left and right frequently. You can fit your code in such a way that you do not have to scroll here and there. Python allows you to write a single statement in multiple lines, also known as line continuation. Line continuation enhances readability as well.
# types of Continuation
* Implicit Line Continuation
* Explicit Line Continuation
